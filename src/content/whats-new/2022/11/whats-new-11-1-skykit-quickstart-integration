## Introducing the easiest and most secure way to display New Relic dashboards on TVs
We’ve partnered with Skykit to make it easier to broadly share your New Relic dashboards with your teams on large format digital displays like TVs or monitors. By taking advantage of Skykit’s integration with New Relic, you can securely connect your carefully created real-time dashboard to any TV, monitor or digital screen – no matter where they are located throughout your organization. Our cloud-based solution easily connects to 1, 5 or 100 screens.

## Easily share your data with the people who need it
Our integration allows you to remotely push your dashboard to digital signage without the need for USB drives, individual computers connected to screens or other manual inputs. And, our user interface is extremely easy to use - you can successfully add a dashboard and display it instantly. Rely on SSO? Not a problem; we can securely authenticate your New Relic dashboard to media players and screens using your SSO tool of choice.
